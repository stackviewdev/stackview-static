            "content": "It is well known that Pandas is a popular library for manipulating and analyzing data. Additionally, it is widely used in Python and is open-source. Most of the time, we find that the data is enormous when we begin analyzing it. Once we analyzed the data, we discovered some columns were not necessary or sometimes we needed to preprocess it. It could be anything. Once the data has been refined, we want to save it locally so we can use it in the future without having to repeat the entire process. Pandas have a method .to_csv() for storing data into CSV files which are exported and saved locally. The following code demonstrates how it works. import pandas as pd #Create a simple data frame data = { 'Name': ['John', 'Mary', 'James', 'Linda', 'Robert'], 'Age': [28, 23, 31, 19, 36], 'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix'] } df = pd.DataFrame(data) #Write the dataframe object into a CSV file df.to_csv(&quot;/path/to/your/csvfile.csv&quot;, index=False, sep=',', encoding='utf-8') print(&quot;File Created Successfully&quot;) Copy Code Parameters used in .to_csv() functions. 👉 The first parameter specifies the name of the CSV file (in my case, it's &quot;csvfile.csv&quot;). You would need to specify the full path if the file is not in the same directory as your script. 👉 index=False means that we will not write row names (index). If you want to include the index, you can set index=True or remove this parameter because its default value is True. 👉 sep=',' defines the delimiter to use. In this case, we use a comma. 👉 encoding='utf-8' specifies the encoding to be used for the file. This is optional, and if not specified, it will default to 'utf-8'. This script will create the csvfile.csv file in the same directory after it is run. You can create the file in another directory by replacing csvfile.csv with the full path. An example would be: import pandas as pd #Create a simple data frame data = { 'Name': ['John', 'Mary', 'James', 'Linda', 'Robert'], 'Age': [28, 23, 31, 19, 36], 'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix'] } df = pd.DataFrame(data) #Write the data frame object into a CSV file df.to_csv(&quot;/path/to/your/csvfile.csv&quot;, index=False, sep=',', encoding='utf-8') print(&quot;File Created Successfully&quot;) Copy Code Make sure you replace /path/to/your/csvfile.csv with your actual CSV file path. Hopefully 🙌 this blog helps you. Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs) In the CSV file, how can I make sure that special characters are exported properly? DataFrames with special characters can easily be exported to CSV files using to_csv()'s encoding parameter. Pandas will correctly handle Unicode characters in your data if you specify encoding='utf-8'. You can use DataFrame.to_csv('my_file.csv', encoding='utf-8') to manage these characters properly. Is there a way to include or exclude the DataFrame's index when exporting to CSV? CSV files generated by the to_csv() function include the DataFrame's index by default. Pass index=False as an argument to the function if you want to exclude it. An example would be DataFrame.to_csv(filename, index=False). As an alternative, you can use this argument or set index=True to include the index. What is the function name in pandas to export a DataFrame to a CSV file? A DataFrame can be exported to a CSV file using the to_csv() function in pandas. DataFrame.to_csv(filename) is the basic syntax, where 'filename' is the name of the CSV file to generate.",

            "content": "What is Exploratory Data Analysis? In simple words: EDA is a process or approach to finding out the most useful features from a datasetaccording to your problem which helps you to choose the correct and efficient algorithm for your solution. Why is Exploratory Data Analysis Important? As we know there are some prerequisites for every project and we can say that EDA is a prerequisite process for any data science or machine learning project. If you are in a hurry and skip EDA then you may face some outliers and too many missing values and, therefore, some bad outcomes for the project: Wrong model Right model on wrong data Selection of wrong features for model building How to do Exploratory Data Analysis? We can do EDA with programming languages and data visualization tools. The most popular programming languages are: Python R The most popular data visualization tools are: Tableau Power BI Infogram Plotly Let’s dive into the Iris Flower dataset: To download the Iris flower dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) Key points about the dataset: 1. The shape of data is (150 * 4) which means rows are 150 and columns are 4 and these columns are named sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 2. There is a species column that tells us about the label of the flower according to the given data there are three categories of flower named Iris setosa, Iris Verginica, and Iris versicolor. 3. Dataset is having 33% of each category's data. Now we are going to do EDA with the programming language named Python. Python has a massive amount of libraries to apply the various types of operations on data to find out the best results. Import some important Libraries. # Import libraries import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns Copy Code The next step is to load data. if data is in CSV format then use these lines of code to load data into a variable named Data. iris = pd.read_csv(\"iris.csv\") Copy Code To observe the top 5 rows of the data using the head function which gives the first 5 rows of the data. iris.head() Copy Code OUTPUT: To check the last five rows of the data we can use data.tail() and for modifying the number of rows we can use data.head(3) or data.tail(3). To check the dimensionality of the dataset iris.shape() Copy Code OUTPUT: The shape of the data is (150, 4) To check the column names or feature names iris.columns Copy Code OUTPUT: Index([‘sepal_length’, ‘sepal_width’, ‘petal_length’, ‘petal_width’, ‘species’], dtype = ‘object’ ) To check how many points of each class iris['species'].values_count() Copy Code OUTPUT: versicolor: 50, setosa: 50, virginica: 50 As we can observe all three classes are equally distributed in terms of the number of counts of each class. Here we can understand a very interesting concept called balanced and imbalanced dataset. Balanced Dataset Let's say we have 10000 rows and it has 2 classes. and class A has 4000 points(point = row) and class B has 6000 points this dataset is a balanced dataset. (Examples: (5000, 5000), (5500, 4500), (6000, 4000)). Imbalanced Dataset Let's say we have 10000 rows and it has 2 classes. and class A has 2000 points and class B has 8000 points and this dataset is the imbalanced dataset. (Examples: (1000, 9000), (1500, 8500), (2000, 8000)) We aim to get a balanced dataset our machine learning algorithms could be biased and inaccurate if data is imbalanced. there are various techniques to handle the case of an imbalanced dataset you can go to this link From the above explanation, you may get some idea about the balanced and imbalanced datasets. Some Basic information about the dataset iris.info() Copy Code Observation Now we can say that there is not any data point missing in any feature. And all first 4 features are of float64 type which is used in numpy and pandas. And indexes are from 0 to 149 for 150 entries. And the last column is of type object which is used for the class labels. The memory used by this data frame is around 6 KB. Some Visual views of data # First plot plt.plot(iris[\"species\"]) plt.xlabel(\"No. of data points\") plt.show() Second plot plt.hist(iris[&quot;species&quot;],color=&quot;green&quot;) plt.show() Copy Code Here we see visually by plotting a graph by no. of data points of each class label. To observe more about the data we can see a basic description of the data iris.describe() Copy Code Observation By describing the dataset we can find out the overall mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values in each feature, 25, 50, 75 percentile of data distribution. And many more things in another dataset. We can’t find any useful information in this dataset that tells us about a very useful feature that helps classify all three iris, and flower classes. To do that we can apply some other techniques to find out important features such as plots of various types. Scatter plot A scatter plot is a set of points plotted on horizontal and vertical axes. Scatter plots are important in statistics because they can show the extent of correlation, if any, between the values of observed quantities or phenomena (called variables). If no correlation exists between the variables, the points appear randomly scattered on the coordinate plane. If a large correlation exists, the points concentrate near a straight line. This has come under bivariate analysis. Observation Wow! Here we can see that black color data points(setosa) are totally separate from the other two class data points by a straight line when we plot a scatter plot with the help of sepal length and sepal width. But the separation of Versicolor from Virginica is much harder because they are considered overlaps. To solve this problem we have to observe many other plots. Here we have a scatter plot with only two features but we have to observe all pairs of the features (4c2 = 6) combinations to see all features in 2D space which is not a good practice and effective by doing one by one. So we have good news we can do it by a single line of code with a pair plot. Pair plot By default, this function will create a grid of Axes such that each variable in data will be shared in the y-axis across a single row and in the x-axis across a single column. The diagonal Axes are treated differently, drawing a plot to show the univariate distribution of the data for the variable in that column. Disadvantage: we can not visualize higher dimension data like 10D data it is perfect for up to 6D data. And work only in 2D data. If you want to observe 3D scatter plot go to this link. This has come under bivariate data analysis. sb.set_style('whitegrid') sb.pairplot(iris,hue='species',size=3) plt.show() Copy Code Observation We can observe from the pair plot that petal length and petal width are the most useful features to classify iris flower to there respective class. Verginica and Versicolor are a little bit overlapped but they are almost linearly separable. There are many other ways to know about the dataset if the above method is not work in any case. Now we are going to study PDF, CDF, and HISTOGRAM. Why do we need a histogram? iris_setosa = iris.loc[iris['species']=='setosa'] iris_versicolor = iris.loc[iris['species']=='versicolor'] iris_virginica = iris.loc[iris['species']=='virginica'] plt.plot(iris_setosa['petal_length'],np.zeros_like(iris_setosa['petal_length'],),'o',label='setosa') plt.plot(iris_virginica['petal_length'],np.zeros_like(iris_virginica['petal_length'],),'o',label='virginica') plt.plot(iris_versicolor['petal_length'],np.zeros_like(iris_versicolor['petal_length'],),'o',label='versicolor') plt.xlabel(&quot;petal_length&quot;) plt.grid() plt.legend() plt.show() Copy Code Observation The disadvantage of this 1D scatter plot is a lot of overlap between Versicolor and Verginica and we can not say anything about it. To overcome this problem we need a histogram. Histogram and Density Curve on the same plot If you wish to have both the histogram and densities in the same plot, the seaborn package (imported as sns) allows you to do that via the distplot(). Since Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib, you can use the sns and plt one after the other. This has come under univariate data analysis. sb.FacetGrid(iris,hue=\"species\",size=5).map(sb.distplot,'petal_length').add_legend() plt.show() Copy Code Observation Its X-axis tells us all setosa flowers are having a petal length between 1 and 1.8. And Versicolor has petal lengths between 3 and 5.2 and Virginica have petal length between 4.5 and 6.9. Its Y-axis tells us the count of the flower at this x value. or how often they come at this value. And Setosa is fully separated from the other two classes but Versicolor and Virginica are not fully separated they have some overlap of some data points. At x = 5 there is a high probability to get Virginica rather than Versicolor because the height of the Virginica histogram if larger than Versicolor. And this smooth curve is called PDF (Probability Density Function). it is a smooth histogram. PDF(Probability Density Function) The PDF is the density of probability rather than the probability mass. The concept is very similar to mass density in physics. OR The probability density function (PDF) is a statistical expression that defines probability distribution as a continuous random variable as opposed to a discrete random variable. When the PDF is graphically portrayed, the area under the curve will indicate the interval in which the variable will fall. The total area in this interval of the graph equals the probability of a continuous random variable occurring. For other features sb.FacetGrid(iris,hue=\"species\",size=5).map(sb.distplot, 'petal_width').add_legend() plt.show() Copy Code sb.FacetGrid(iris,hue=\"species\",size=5).map(sb.distplot, 'sepal_length').add_legend() plt.show() Copy Code sb.FacetGrid(iris,hue=\"species\",size=5).map(sb.distplot, 'sepal_width').add_legend() plt.show() Copy Code Observation Petal length will do a great job to classify all classes of flowers but we can say that petal length is slightly better than the petal width because petal width is also doing a better job. sepal length and sepal width are not good features to classify iris flowers petal length &gt; petal width &gt;&gt;&gt; sepal length &gt;&gt;&gt;sepal width. CDF (Cumulative distribution function) In probability theory and statistics, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a real-valued random variable X, or just distribution function of X, evaluated at x, is the probability that X will take a value less than or equal to x. To plot a CDF and PDF counts,bin_edges=np.histogram(iris_setosa['petal_length'],bins=10,density=True) pdf= counts/(sum(counts)) print(pdf) print(bin_edges) cdf=np.cumsum(pdf) plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf,label='pdf') plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],cdf,label='cdf') plt.legend() plt.show() Copy Code This is only for the setosa class petal length. Observation Let’s take petal length is equals to 1.5 and then observe it by CDF and PDF. Now we can say that 61% of setosa flowers having petal length is less than 1.5 or in another way we can say between 1.4 and 1.5 petal lengths we have 28% setosa flowers. To plot PDF and CDF for all class counts,bin_edges=np.histogram(iris_setosa['petal_length'],bins=10,density=True) pdf= counts/(sum(counts)) print(pdf) print(bin_edges) to compute cdf cdf=np.cumsum(pdf) plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf,label='pdf') plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],cdf,label='cdf') counts,bin_edges=np.histogram(iris_virginica['petal_length'],bins=10,density=True) pdf= counts/(sum(counts)) print(pdf) print(bin_edges) to compute cdf cdf=np.cumsum(pdf) plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf,label='pdf') plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],cdf,label='cdf') counts,bin_edges=np.histogram(iris_versicolor['petal_length'],bins=10,density=True) pdf= counts/(sum(counts)) print(pdf) print(bin_edges) to compute cdf cdf=np.cumsum(pdf) plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf,label='pdf') plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],cdf,label='cdf') plt.legend() plt.show() Copy Code Mean, variance, and standard deviation To get more ideas about data. # Means of the petal length print(\"Means\") print(\"setosa\",np.mean(iris_setosa[\"petal_length\"])) print(\"versicolor\",np.mean(iris_versicolor[\"petal_length\"])) print(\"virginica\",np.mean(iris_virginica[\"petal_length\"])) standard-daviation print(&quot;standard-daviation&quot;) print(&quot;setosa :&quot;,np.std(iris_setosa[&quot;petal_length&quot;])) print(&quot;versicolor :&quot;,np.std(iris_versicolor[&quot;petal_length&quot;])) print(&quot;virginica :&quot;,np.std(iris_virginica[&quot;petal_length&quot;])) median print(&quot;median&quot;) print(&quot;setosa :&quot;,np.median(iris_setosa[&quot;petal_length&quot;])) print(&quot;versicolor :&quot;,np.median (iris_versicolor[&quot;petal_length&quot;])) print(&quot;virginica :&quot;,np.median (iris_virginica[&quot;petal_length&quot;])) Copy Code here if we talk about variance then this is a spread of how far our elements are spread (width of histogram’s graph) We can observe various things by only one or two plots and the names of those plots are BOX plot and VIOLIN plot. but to understand these plots we have to understand the basic concept of percentile. Percentile x percentile tells us what % of data points are smaller than this value and what % of elements are greater than this value. The 50th percentile is the median. 25th,50th,75th, and 100th percentiles are called quantiles. 25th is a first, 50th is a second, 75th is a third, and 100th is the fourth quantile. print(\"90th percentile\") print(\"setosa:\",np.percentile(iris_setosa[\"petal_length\"],90)) print(\"versicolor:\",np.percentile(iris_versicolor[\"petal_length\"],90)) print(\"virginica:\",np.percentile(iris_virginica[\"petal_length\"],90)) Copy Code What is a box and whisker plot? A box and whisker plot — also called a box plot — displays the five-number summary of a set of data. The five-number summary is the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In a box plot, we draw a box from the first quartile to the third quartile. A vertical line goes through the box at the median. The whiskers go from each quartile to the minimum or maximum. sb.boxplot(x='species',y='petal_length',data=iris) plt.grid() plt.show() Copy Code What is a violin plot? A violin plot is a method of plotting numeric data. It is similar to a box plot, with the addition of a rotated kernel density plot on each side. Violin plots are similar to box plots, except that they also show the probability density of the data at different values, usually smoothed by a kernel density estimator. b.violinplot(x='species',y='petal_length',data=iris,size=8) plt.grid() plt.show() Copy Code A 3D plot of the iris flower dataset import plotly.express as px fig = px.scatter_3d(Data, x='sepal_length', y='sepal_width', z='petal_width', color='species') fig.show() Copy Code Thanks for visiting StackView",

            "content": "What is object-oriented programming(OOPs)? As the name suggests, programming that is oriented with objects. It sounds cool, but what does it mean? An object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming standard that is based on the concept of objects. That's fine but what is an object? Hope you got an idea about the object. NOTE: We will use OOPs as object-oriented programming in short form Let's discuss OOPs in detail. For example, We have to make a software application in which we have many features like catalog, payment, checkout, authentication and many more. In order to design/model that system through OOPs standards we have to make a collection of objects, where each object represents some particular feature of the system. The characteristics of an object are described by its data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Wait, Why are we concern about this design and objects? Okay, so let's discuss about the advantages of the OOPs. Advantages of OOPs In software development, object-oriented programming (OOPs) has several advantages: 1. Modularity: OOPs allows you to modularize your code, meaning that you can break it down into smaller, independent units (objects) that can be easily reused and maintained. This makes it easier to understand and update your code. 2. Flexibility: In addition to allowing you to extend or modify your code more easily, it also gives you the ability to make new classes that inherit from existing classes some of their attributes and behavior. 3. Reusability: A key advantage of OOPs is the ability to reuse code between different objects, which can save you a lot of time and effort while developing an application. 4. Scalability: OOPs allows you to easily scale your code as your project grows, as you are able to add new objects and functionality as your project grows. 5. Maintainability: OOPs makes it easier to maintain your code. This is because you can make changes to a single class and have those changes automatically reflected in all the objects of that class. 6. Readability: The clear and modular structure of OOPs promotes easier reading and understanding of your code. 7. Testability: OOPs makes it easier to test your code, as you can test individual objects and their behavior separately from the rest of the code. That's great, I want to learn OOPs now. Okay, Basically we have four main principles of OOPs. Four main principles of OOPs In object-oriented programming, we have four main principles/concepts which allow us to achieve all these benefits, and in a nutshell, these four concepts are: 1. Encapsulation 2. Abstraction 3. Inheritance 4. Polymorphism Let's take a closer look at each one of them one by one. 1. Encapsulation (What is Encapsulation?) Encapsulation is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the idea of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. Encapsulation allows you to hide the implementation details of a class from other parts of your code. This makes it easier to change or update the implementation without affecting the rest of the code. In OOP, you can achieve encapsulation through the use of access modifiers, such as public, private, and protected. These modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods) from outside the class. For example, you might want to mark certain attributes or methods as private. This is because you only want them to be accessible within the class itself, and not from outside the class. This can help prevent other parts of your code from accidentally or intentionally modifying the internal state of the object. Here's an example of encapsulation in Python using a simple BankAccount class: class BankAccount: def __init__(self, balance): self.__balance = balance # private attribute def check_balance(self): return self.__balance def deposit(self, amount): self.__balance += amount def withdraw(self, amount): if self.__balance &gt;= amount: self.__balance -= amount return True else: return False Copy Code In this example, the BankAccount class has a balance attribute that is marked as private by prefixing it with two underscores (__). This means that the balance attribute can only be accessed or modified from within the BankAccount class, and not from outside the class. To access or modify the balance attribute from outside the class, you can define public methods like deposit, check_balance, withdraw. 2. Abstraction (What is Abstraction?) Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOPs) that refers to the idea of exposing only the necessary details of an object to the user, while hiding the implementation details. Abstraction allows you to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it. In OOPs, abstraction can be achieved in several ways: 1. Abstract classes: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (means we can't create an object from that class), but can be subclassed. Abstract classes define a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete (non-abstract) subclass. Abstract methods are methods that are declared in the abstract class, but do not have an implementation. This allows you to define a common interface for a group of related classes, while leaving the implementation details up to individual subclasses. 2. Interfaces: An interface is a set of abstract methods that define a common set of behaviors that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. Interfaces are similar to abstract classes, but they cannot have any implementation details and cannot have any attributes. 3. Information hiding: Information hiding is the practice of hiding the implementation details of a class from the user. This can be achieved through the use of access modifiers, such as private and protected, which control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods) from outside the class. A Python abstract class and interface are used here to illustrate abstraction: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod class BankAccount(ABC): @abstractmethod def deposit(self, amount): pass @abstractmethod def withdraw(self, amount): pass @abstractmethod def check_balance(self): pass class SavingsAccount(BankAccount): def init(self, balance): self.balance = balance def deposit(self, amount): self.balance += amount def withdraw(self, amount): if self.balance &gt;= amount: self.balance -= amount return True else: return False def check_balance(self): return self.balance class CurrentAccount(BankAccount): def init(self, balance, overdraft_limit): self.balance = balance self.overdraft_limit = overdraft_limit def deposit(self, amount): self.balance += amount def withdraw(self, amount): if self.balance - amount &gt;= -self.overdraft_limit: self.balance -= amount return True else: return False def check_balance(self): return self.balance Copy Code In this example, the BankAccount interface defines the abstract methods deposit, withdraw, and check_balance that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. The SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes both implement the BankAccount interface, meaning they must provide implementations of these abstract methods. This allows you to define a common interface for different types of bank accounts, while leaving the implementation details up to the individual subclasses. 3. Inheritance (What is Inheritance?) Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the ability of a class to inherit the attributes and behaviors of another class. Using inheritance, you can create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. Classes can be arranged in hierarchies and code can be reused within them. Python allows inheritance by defining a subclass and specifying the superclass in parentheses after the subclass name. Subclasses inherit all the attributes and behaviors of the superclass, as well as being able to define their own unique attributes and behaviors. Here's an example of inheritance in Python using a simple BankAccount class and two subclasses: SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount: class BankAccount: def __init__(self, balance): self.balance = balance def deposit(self, amount): self.balance += amount def withdraw(self, amount): if self.balance &gt;= amount: self.balance -= amount return True else: return False def check_balance(self): return self.balance class SavingsAccount(BankAccount): def init(self, balance, interest_rate): super().init(balance) # call the superclass constructor self.interest_rate = interest_rate def add_interest(self): self.balance += self.balance * self.interest_rate class CurrentAccount(BankAccount): def init(self, balance, overdraft_limit): super().init(balance) # call the superclass constructor self.overdraft_limit = overdraft_limit def withdraw(self, amount): if self.balance - amount &gt;= -self.overdraft_limit: self.balance -= amount return True else: return False Copy Code In this example, the SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount classes both inherit from the BankAccount superclass. This means that they both have access to the deposit, withdraw, and check_balance methods of the BankAccount class, as well as their own unique methods: add_interest for SavingsAccount and an overridden withdraw method for CurrentAccount. 4. Polymorphism (What is Polymorphism?) In object-oriented programming (OOPs), polymorphism refers to a class's ability to take on multiple forms. A polymorphic interface (e.g., a method or function) is one that can be implemented by many classes, each having its own implementation. By doing this, you are able to write code that can work with a variety of objects without needing to know what type of object it is working with. There are several ways to achieve polymorphism in OOPs: 1. Method overloading: This is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters. When the method is called, the correct implementation is chosen based on the number and type of arguments passed to the method. 2. Method overriding: This is the ability to define a method in a subclass that has the same name and parameters as a method in the superclass, but with a different implementation. When the method is called, the subclass implementation is used instead of the superclass 3. Dynamic dispatch: This is the ability to determine at runtime which method to call based on the type of the object being called. This can be achieved through the use of inheritance and method override. An example of polymorphism in Python might be a bank account system that has a base class called &quot;Account&quot; and two subclasses called &quot;CurrentAccount&quot; and &quot;SavingsAccount&quot;. The Account class might define methods such as &quot;deposit&quot; and &quot;withdraw&quot; that are common to both types of accounts, while the CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount classes might override these methods to implement account-specific behavior, such as calculating and applying fees or interest. class Account: def init(self, balance=0): self.balance = balance def deposit(self, amount): self.balance += amount return self.balance def withdraw(self, amount): if amount &gt; self.balance: raise ValueError(&quot;Insufficient funds&quot;) self.balance -= amount return self.balance class CurrentAccount(Account): def init(self, balance=0): super().init(balance) self.fee = 0.01 def withdraw(self, amount): return super().withdraw(amount + self.fee) class SavingsAccount(Account): def init(self, balance=0): super().init(balance) self.interest_rate = 0.02 def deposit(self, amount): return super().deposit(amount * (1 + self.interest_rate)) Copy Code In this example, the CurrentAccount class overrides the withdraw method to apply a fee to the withdrawal amount. In contrast, the SavingsAccount class overrides the deposit method to apply interest to the deposited amount. These subclasses can be used in the same way as the base Account class, but the methods will behave differently depending on the type of account being used. For example: checking_account = CheckingAccount(100) savings_account = SavingsAccount(100) checking_account.deposit(50) # returns 150 savings_account.deposit(50) # returns 105 checking_account.withdraw(75) # returns 73.75 savings_account.withdraw(75) # returns 25 Copy Code In this code, the deposit method for the CurrentAccount class is called with a value of 50, which is added to the account balance and a fee of 0.01 is applied. The deposit method for the SavingsAccount class is called with a value of 50, which is added to the account balance and interest of 0.02 is applied. The withdraw method for the CurrentAccount class is called with a value of 75, which is subtracted from the account balance and a fee of 0.01 is applied. The withdraw method for the SavingsAccount class is called with a value of 75, which is subtracted from the account balance. Conclusion Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects, which are data structures that contain both data and methods that operate on that data. OOP is designed to make it easier to design and maintain complex software systems by organizing code into reusable objects and by encapsulating the implementation details of those objects. The four pillars of OOP are inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. Inheritance allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class, and can be used to create a hierarchy of classes and reuse code between them. Encapsulation refers to the idea of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or object, and hiding the implementation details of that object from other parts of the code. Abstraction refers to the idea of exposing only the necessary details of an object to the user, while hiding the implementation details. Polymorphism refers to the ability of a class to take on multiple forms, through method overloading, method overriding, and dynamic dispatch. OOP has many advantages, including code reuse, modularity, and maintainability. However, it is not the only programming paradigm, and there are other approaches, such as procedural programming and functional programming, that may be better suited for certain tasks. Ultimately, the choice of programming paradigm will depend on the specific needs of the project and the preferences of the programmer.",

            "content": "As we all know, Python is a versatile language with lots of possibilities. So in this article, we will see how to write python code with some tricks so that it can reduce the number of lines you have to write to get the same functionality. Irrespective of your experience these tricks will help you. We've covered the tricks with lists, strings, tuples, sets, etc. 1. Reverse a &quot;List&quot; Generally, In python, we use the reverse() function to reverse a list but we can do it another with a simple trick. And the trick is 👇 Code # An example of a list a=[\"apple\", 30, \"mango\", 50, \"banana\", 10] TRICK: to reverse a list print(a[::-1]) Copy Code Output # Reversed list [10, 'banana', 50, 'mango', 30, 'apple'] Copy Code 2. Combining two different lists with &quot;zip()&quot; method The zip() method takes one or more iterables (such as list, tuple, string, etc.) and constructs the iterator of tuples where each tuple contains elements from each iterable that you have provided. Code # First iterable a=[1,2,3,4,5,6] # Second iterable b=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"] # Creating an iterator object (type zip) zip_obj = zip(a, b) # Now we can iterate through this iterator object for item in zip_obj: # Iterm is a tuple print(item) Copy Code Output (1, 'A') (2, 'B') (3, 'C') (4, 'D') (5, 'E') (6, 'F') Copy Code 3. Convert a string to a List with the &quot;split()&quot; method If you have a string and you want to convert that into a list so we can do it simply by using the split() method. Code string=\"Splitting Strings are easy with this method\" list_of_string_items = string.split() print(list_of_string_items) Copy Code Output ['Splitting', 'Strings', 'are', 'easy', 'with', 'this', 'method'] Copy Code Wait!✋ After splitting strings, we can even join them with the help of join() function. Code a_join = [\"We\", \"can\", \"easily\", \"join\", \"strings \", \"using\", \"join\"] print(&quot; &quot;.join(a_join)) Copy Code Output \"We can easily join strings using join\" Copy Code 4. Transpose a matrix(2D Array) Transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows. In other words, the transpose of A[ ][ ] is obtained by changing A[i][j] to A[j][i]. So to do that, we can use a simple trick with the help of the zip() function. Code # Initial matrix matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 8]] Transposing new_matrix_object = zip(*matrix) Printing transposed matrix for row in new_matrix_object: print(row) Copy Code Output (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) Copy Code 5. Iterate with enumerate() instead of range(len()) The method enumerate() keeps track of both the index and the number by iterating through a sequence with enumerate() but most people use range(len()). Although range(len()) works, it's much nicer to use the built-in enumerate function here. The current index and item are returned as a tuple. This allows us to directly check the value and access the item. Code numbers = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\"] Example with enumerate for index, value in enumerate(numbers): print(index, value) Copy Code Output 0 one 1 two 2 three 3 four 4 five Copy Code 6. Copy a &quot;List&quot; Python's list-slicing feature can be used to copy a list. And we can do it by just writing a single line. Code list_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] print(\"Address of list_1: \",id(list_1)) copy list list_2 = list_1[:] print(&quot;Address of list_2: &quot;,id(list_2)) Copy Code Output Address of list_1: 140304900372800 Address of list_1: 140304900407616 Copy Code 7. Negative indexing to access list items If you know then good if you don't know that we can access the list of items with negative indexes then check this trick. Code numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Accessing list items with negative indexing print(numbers[-1]) print(numbers[-3]) Copy Code Output 6 4 Copy Code 8. F-String formating This is one of the methods to format the string in Python. And the easiest method without much confusion. Code # Let say i want to print \"Hi I'm John and I'm 19 years old!\" name = &quot;John&quot; age = 19 F-string formatting print(f&quot;Hi, I'm {name} and I'm {age} years old!&quot;) Copy Code Output \"Hi, I'm John and I'm 19 years old!\" Copy Code F-strings are also used to print the value along with an identifier name. Code x = 10 y = 20 print(f&quot;{x = }, {y = }&quot;) Copy Code Output x = 10, y = 20 Copy Code 9. Remove duplicate entries from lists You can remove duplicate elements from a list by converting it to a set (then back to a list). Sets cannot contain duplicates, unlike lists. This is what helped us remove the duplicate elements from our list. Code a = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 3 , 2 ] print(list(set(a))) Copy Code Output [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Copy Code 10. Save memory with generators If you are working with a large dataset and if you want to save a lot of memory while performing that task then you can use a generator instead of using a list. Code import sys # Creating a sum of the 10000 numbers with List number_list = [i for i in range(10000)] print(sum(number_list)) # Checking the memory it is consuming to perform this task with List print(sys.getsizeof(number_list), \"bytes\") # Creating a sum of the 10000 numbers with a Generator number_generator = (i for i in range(10000)) print(sum(number_generator)) # Checking the memory it is consuming to perform this task with Generator print(sys.getsizeof(number_generator), \"bytes\") Copy Code Output 49995000 85176 bytes 49995000 112 bytes Copy Code Thanks for reading this article and visiting StackView.",

            "content": "Introduction to OS Module As we all know Python is very popular for its large standard libraries. And it has a module called os A module that provides runtime interaction with the operating system for creating, removing, fetching, changing, and identifying directories files and paths. Getting started with OS Module in Python Installation OS is a part of Python's default standard libraries so don't require to install just import os before using its functions and you are done. The OS module is one of Python's standard utilities🤖. import os Copy Code Common function of the OS Module os.mkdir() To create new directories by using os.mkdir() it takes a single argument which is the name of new directory. import os os.mkdir(\"newdir\") Copy Code The function creates a new directory named newdir in the current working directory. os.getcwd() os.getcwd() returns the current working directory (CWD) of your current location where your Python script is running. import os print(os.getcwd()) Copy Code os.chdir() We can use os.chdir() it to change your current working directory. This function takes a single argument which will be your CWD. import os os.chdir(\"/new/directory\") Copy Code os.rmdir() It is possible to remove the specified directory with an absolute path using the os.rmdir() function. This function also takes a single argument. import os os.rmdir(\"/path/to/directory\") Copy Code os.listdir() os.listdir() is used to get a list of all files and directories in your current working directory. list_of_files = os.listdir() print(list_of_files) Copy Code os.error() When invalid or inaccessible file names or paths are encountered, os.error() raises an OSError. import os try: filename = 'os_python.txt' f = open(filename, 'r') text = f.read() f.close() except IOError: print(' Reading : ' + filename) Copy Code os.popen() A file object attached to a pipe is returned by os.popen(), which opens a file or runs a command. import os new_file = \"python.txt\" # popen() is similar to open() file = open(new_file, 'w') file.write(\"Welcome!To codeasify \") file.close() file = open(new_file, 'r') text = file.read() print(text) # popen() provides gateway and accesses the file directly file = os.popen(new_file, 'w') file.write(\"This is awesome\") Copy Code os.close() Files associated with descriptor fr are closed with this function. import os new_file = \"Python1.txt\" file = open(new_file, 'r') text = file.read() print(text) os.close(file) Copy Code os.rename() os.rename() is used to rename files. If the user has the privilege to change a file. It takes two arguments. import os os.rename(\"old_name\", \"new_name\") Copy Code os.access() The invoking user's uid and gid are used to test if the path is accessible. import os import sys path_1 = os.access(\"Python.txt\", os.F_OK) print(\"Exist path:\", path_1) # Checking access with os.R_OK path_2 = os.access(\"Python.txt\", os.R_OK) print(\"It access to read the file:\", path_2) # Checking access with os.W_OK path_3 = os.access(\"Python.txt\", os.W_OK) print(\"It access to write the file:\", path_3) # Checking access with os.X_OK path_4 = os.access(\"Python.txt\", os.X_OK) print(\"Check if path can be executed:\", path_4) Copy Code Working with file paths with OS module in Python os.path.join() os.path.join() is helpful to concatenate multiple strings to create a valid path. Follow the given example. import os path = os.path.join('directory', 'subdirectory', 'filename') print(path) Copy Code os.path.split() os.path.split() is used to separate a file name and the directory. this function takes the complete file path and split it into two parts one is head and the second is the tail. Follow the given example. head, tail = os.path.split('/directory/subdirectory/file.txt') print(head) # Output: /directory/subdirectory print(tail) # Output: file.txt Copy Code os.path.exists() os.path.exists() checks whether a mentioned file name exists or not. if it exists then it returns True if not then it returns False. if os.path.exists('file.txt'): print(\"The file exists!\") else: print(\"The file does not exist.\") Copy Code os.path.isdir() os.path.isdir() checks whether a mentioned path is a directory or not. if it exists then it returns True if not then it returns False. if os.path.isdir('file.txt'): print(\"is directory\") else: print(\"not a directory\") Copy Code os.path.isfile() os.path.isfile() checks whether a mentioned path is a file or not. if it exists then it returns True if not then it returns False. if os.path.isfile('file.txt'): print(\"is file!\") else: print(\"not a file\") Copy Code Environment variables set by OS packages Programs running on a system can access and modify environment variables using the environment attribute in the OS package. Environment variables can be manipulated in several ways with the OS package: 1. Reading Environment Variables: For instance, to retrieve the value of the PATH environment variable, use the method os.environ.get(): import os path = os.environ.get('PATH') print(path) Copy Code 2. Configuring/Writing Environment Variables: The os.environ() dictionary allows you to set an environment variable's value. For example, the following code sets the value of var to &quot;hello&quot;: import os os.environ['var'] = 'hello' Copy Code You can only modify the environment variables for the current Python process and any child processes it creates by using os.environ. 3. Deleting Environment Variables: You can delete an environment variable using the os.environ.pop() method For example, to delete the var environment variable, you can use the following code: import os os.environ.pop(‘var’, None) Copy Code It is returned by pop() method if the environment variable has been removed. If the environment variable does not exist, the value of None is returned. 4. List All Environment Variables: Using the os.environ.items() method, you can see the values of all environment variables. For example, you can do the following: import os for key, value in os.environ.items(): print(key, value) Copy Code Conclusion A platform-independent way of interacting with the operating system is provided by the os module in Python. It provides functions for handling files, directories, environment variables, and processes. Python code written with the os module works seamlessly on different platforms.",

However, a page can always be reloaded by pressing F5 or clicking the reload button in the browser. location.reload() makes the browser cache data faster. Images, documents, and data are stored in a browser cache, which is a temporary internal file. But don't forget, the fastest way to refresh a page is to take a deep breath and count to ten... or just yell 'refresh!' really loud 😂. location.reload() defaults to false this parameter requests a server refresh. When false is passed, the webpage is retrieved from the browser's cache. Syntax location.reload() Copy Code Output None (undefined) Copy Code Working Mechanism of reload() function When a web page is loaded in a web 🌐 browser, the browser stores certain resources (like images, stylesheets, and scripts) in its cache. This caching mechanism improves performance by reusing stored resources when revisiting the page. However, it can sometimes lead to problems, especially when you need to ensure that the page reflects the most up-to-date data from the server. By using location.reload(true), you override the browser's caching mechanism and fetch the page directly from the server. This ensures that any changes made to the server-side content are immediately reflected on the page. Forced reload provides a reliable way to update content dynamically. Code &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Hello &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;button onclick=\"myFunction()\"&gt; Reload page &lt;/button&gt; &lt;script&gt; function myFunction() { location.reload(); document.write(\" Welcome To Codeasify \"); } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Copy Code A few common use cases 1. In real-time applications such as stock market prices, news feeds, or chat applications, location.reload(true) can be used to fetch the latest data. 2. After submitting a form, it is common to redirect the user to another page or display a success message. Forceful refresh ensures the user can see the changes immediately in scenarios where the form or data has to be displayed on the same page. 3. Security and Authentication: It is crucial to ensure that a user's session and permissions are up-to-date when dealing with user authentication and security-sensitive operations. The page will reload right away if you change the authentication status or permissions of the user. There are some potential downsides to this 1. While location.reload(true) provides a straightforward solution for refreshing a page, it is imperative to consider its potential drawbacks: 2. Users may lose unsaved data or be unexpectedly taken from their current position on the page if a forceful page reload occurs frequently. 3. Reloading an entire page may increase bandwidth and performance, especially for users with limited internet access or on mobile devices. Alternatives There are alternative techniques for updating specific parts of a web page without reloading the whole page. Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) lets you update specific elements dynamically while making asynchronous requests to the server. You can update data and UI easily with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular. Location.reload(true) is deprecated. How can I fix it? Our solution is to use location.reload() without the force-reload flag instead of location.reload(true). It is also possible to check the JavaScript Window Location, which contains information about the current URL. Conclusion By default, the JS reload() method reloads the page from the cache. However, you may force it to reload the page from the server side by setting the forceGet parameter to true : location.reload(true). Hoping you understood the nuances of location.reload(true) and its applications empower web developers to create dynamic and up-to-date web applications that deliver an exceptional user experience. So, step ahead, and leverage location.reload(true) wisely, and unlock the full potential of your JavaScript projects. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. So, don't use it for evil, or your code may end up reloading...FOREVER!",

Let’s take an example of India, According to Oxfam 2017 report, The top 10% of the Indian population holds 77% of the total national wealth. 73% of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest 1%, while 67 million Indians who comprise the poorest half of the population saw only a 1% increase in their wealth. So as you can see, there is an unequal distribution of wealth in India. It is also much the same in other parts of the world. We often think that if wealth is equally divided then how good it will be. Suppose today is your lucky day, your wish is granted and all the people have decided to distribute wealth equally among themself. Here the question arises. 1. How will you distribute wealth equally? 2. How the government calculates the average salary for a country? 3. Which salary range has the maximum number of people? Here maths comes to solve your problem, we all have heard the three most popular words of maths MEAN, MEDIAN, and MODE. Now we have to find out when and where these are going to help us. Let’s understand it with the help of an example. country X has 10 people and we have their wealth data as given below. Now we come to our first question. How will you distribute wealth equally? First, we have to calculate what is the total wealth. So for that, we will sum up the wealth. Total wealth = 7 + 3 + 20 + 12 + 1 + 9 + 5 + 17 + 22 + 8 = 104 Million Now we calculate how much any individual will get = Total Wealth / Total no. of people = 104 / 10 = 10.4 Million If we distribute wealth equally among all the people then each one will get 10.4 million. What we calculate above, In a maths language that is called MEAN. MEAN MEAN: Mean is the sum of all the items divided by the total number of items. It is also called Average. It’s time for the second question. How the government calculates the average salary for a country? First, we will short(arrange all salaries in increasing or decreasing order) the data. Now we will find out the middle point in the data. But items are even so we will take the middle two items. Here person J and F. Whose wealth are 8 and 9 million respectively. We will take the mean of J and F wealth the find out the middle value. = 8+9 / 2 = 8.5 Million The middle value is 8.5 Million. This is the answer to our second question. This whole process is also called MEDIAN. MEDIAN MEDIAN: The number in the middle in sorted data is called MEDIAN. If data has even items then the Median will be the mean of those two middle values. If data has an odd no. of items. If data has even no. of items. It’s time for our last question. Which salary range has the maximum number of people? First, we will decide the range and count the people in that range. Most of the people have salaries in the range of 5 million to 10 million. It is called MODE in Maths. MODE MODE: Which item has the highest frequency is called MODE. According to the number line,2 is the mode. Thanks for visiting StackView.",

            "content": "MongoDB is an open-source and document-oriented database. It is classified as a NoSQL database that offers flexibility, scalability, and ease of use for handling and storing data at a very large scale. If you want to use MongoDB with Python then PyMongo is one of the most popular Python libraries. With PyMongo, you can easily connect to MongoDB, perform database operations, and perform powerful queries. This blog post explores the essential features and functionalities of MongoDB using the PyMongo Python library. How to use PyMongo step-by-step Step 1: Installation of PyMongo To install PyMongo Generally, we are going to use a Python package manager called pip. Open the command prompt(For Windows users) or terminal(For Linux users) and use the given 👇 command. pip install pymongo Copy Code Step 2: Establish a connection To start working with MongoDB, you must connect with the MongoDB server through PyMongo. Start by importing the pymongo module and using the MongoClient class to create a connection object. from pymongo import MongoClient # Create a MongoDB client mongodb_server_url = &quot;mongodb://localhost:27017/&quot; client = MongoClient(mongodb_server_url) Copy Code Don't worry if you're not connected, just print client 😴 As MongoDB organizes data into databases containing collections, you can access a database using the connection object and get a reference to a collection within it. There is much to do 🤯: db = client[\"mydatabase\"]# Access a database collection = db[\"mycollection\"]# Access a collection Copy Code Keep adding these codes in the previous one 😬. Step 3: Perform CRUD operations 1. Insert a document(Create) Using the insert_one() or insert_many() methods, you can insert a document into a collection. # Single document insertion document = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30} result = collection.insert_one(document) print(\"Inserted document ID:\", result.inserted_id) # Multiple document insertion documents = [ {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 25}, {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 35} ] result = collection.insert_many(documents) print(&quot;Inserted document IDs:&quot;, result.inserted_ids) Copy Code Keep Going We know you can do this 😇... 2. Querying documents(Read) Here's an example of querying documents using PyMongo based on specific criteria: # Find documents where age is greater than 30 query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}} result = collection.find(query) for document in result: print(document) Copy Code 3. Updating document(Update) You can update MongoDB documents with PyMongo by using the update_one() or update_many() methods. # Update a single document query = {\"name\": \"John\"} new_values = {\"$set\": {\"age\": 32}} result = collection.update_one(query, new_values) print(\"Modified documents:\", result.modified_count) # Update multiple documents query = {&quot;age&quot;: {&quot;$gt&quot;: 30}} new_values = {&quot;$inc&quot;: {&quot;age&quot;: 1}} result = collection.update_many(query, new_values) print(&quot;Modified documents:&quot;, result.modified_count) Copy Code 4. Deleting document(Delete) To delete one or multiple documents, use the delete_one() or delete_many() methods: # Delete a single document query = {\"name\": \"John\"} result = collection.delete_one(query) print(\"Deleted documents:\", result.deleted_count) # Delete multiple documents query = {&quot;age&quot;: {&quot;$gt&quot;: 30}} result = collection.delete_many(query) print(&quot;Deleted documents:&quot;, result.deleted_count) Copy Code 5. Aggregation framework PyMongo leverages MongoDB's Aggregation Framework by providing a method called aggregate(): # Perform aggregation pipeline = [ {\"$group\": {\"_id\": \"$name\", \"count\": {\"$sum\": 1}}} ] result = collection.aggregate(pipeline) for document in result: print(document) Copy Code Conclusion This powerful tool enables seamless integration between Python and MongoDB. With an intuitive API, you can insert, query, update, and delete documents using PyMongo. You can also perform complex data analysis and processing. NoSQL databases can be harnessed to build robust and scalable applications with MongoDB and PyMongo. You can find more information about PyMongo's capabilities and additional examples in the PyMongo documentation. Happy Learning 🙂",

You will get a basic understanding of it. &quot;A cronjob is a scheduled task [report creation, database cleaning, and sending emails] that runs automatically without any manual intervention at specific time intervals. Cronjobs are managed by cron daemon which is a background service that handles scheduling and execution of these tasks.&quot; Cronjobs have a specific syntax. The basic structure looks like this 👇 * * * * * command_to_be_executed Copy Code Here 5 stars is nothing but a cron expression that tells how and when to repeat this cronjob. And at the place of command_to_be_executed is going to be your tasks path. To use cronjobs in Django projects there is a package called django-crontab which is a very powerful tool that allows us to do all these things effortlessly. We will walk you through the steps. Prerequisites Before jumping directly into working with cronjobs these are the things we required: 1. Installation of Python &amp; Django on your local machine or server. 2. You should have a Django project. If not Click Here Install django-crontab package Now install a package with pip pip install django-crontab Copy Code After installation is done we have to follow some steps given below Add django_crontab into your INSTALLED_APPS inside settings.py # settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [ # ... 'django_crontab', # ... ] Copy Code Configuration of cronjobs Before configuration, you have to create a script that is going to work as a cronjob. Inside your APP create a script APP/cronscript.py then write your logic. # Cronjob Def myCron(): # Write your logic here Copy Code Now you have to add your cronjobs to your settings.py as given below # settings.py CRONJOBS = [ ('*/5 * * * *', 'your_app.cronscript.myCron'), # Add more cron jobs as needed here in this list ] Copy Code Install cronjobs to crontab By installing your cronjobs to crontab they will be executed at their scheduled time and intervals. To do this follow the below command python manage.py crontab add Copy Code This will install your cronjobs mentioned in the settings.py file. And it will give you IDs for all of your cronjobs. Please take a look selected values. With these IDs you can manage your crons like show your cron, remove your cron, run your cron all these things can be done. Managing cron Jobs Run With this command, you can run a particular cronjob. python manage.py crontab run fbefaf90a92771be066062500ec446b6 Copy Code Show With this command, You can see all cronjobs in this project. python manage.py crontab show Copy Code Remove With this command, You can remove all cronjobs in this project. python manage.py crontab remove Copy Code For more information please follow this Link",

Basically, Git is a version control system that allows developers/programmers to manage and track changes to their codebases (especially when we have multiple team members). The following are the top ten most commonly used Git commands that every developer should know. 1. Git init In simple words, `git init` creates/initializes a Git repository in your current working directory. Any other commands can only be run after running this command, which means this is the very first command you have to run to work with Git. Actually, it will create a subdirectory in your current working directory named `.git`. Which contains your all tracking information. How to use &quot;git init&quot;? git init Copy Code Here we can see the demo As we can see we got the &quot;.git&quot; subdirectory after running git init. 2. git clone `git clone` is the command to download an existing source code from a remote repository like (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and etc..) into your local system. It will create a directory of the same name as we have in our remote repository. And copy all the code inside that directory. How to use &quot;git clone&quot;? git clone https://link-to-your-repository.git Copy Code Okay, that's fine, but where are we getting this link from? Go to repository &gt; Click on green Code button &gt; Copy HTTPS link To get this link see the below image: Here is the demonstration of cloning a repository 3. git status With `git status` we can check the status of the current git repository and whether your git repository is updated as your current working directory code. It shows various things about the local git repository 1. This shows the files that have been modified in our working directory in comparison with the git repository staging area. 2. Files that are untracked. 3. Your current working branch. 4. And many more How to use &quot;git status&quot;? git status Copy Code Here is the demonstration of the git status command. 4. git add This command `git add` is used to add the untracked, modified, newly created, and deleted files into the git staging area. But why? As long as a file is in the staging area, then whenever we commit, all staging files will be tracked by the commit command. Without adding them to the staging area, they cannot be committed. How to use &quot;git add&quot;? We have two options to use the `git add` command. 1. Add all files in one go 2. Add files manually one by one # Add all files in one go git add -A or git add . Add files one by one manually git add &lt;file_name&gt; Copy Code Here is the demonstration for adding all files in one go for the git add command 5. git commit Let's take a closer look at this command. To save the changes that are present in the staging area to your git repository, we use the `git commit` command. Think of it as a checkpoint for our changes so far. And every commit needs to have a tag/message (like a description of your changes) to make it more understandable for future team members and for ourselves also. How to use &quot;git commit&quot;? git commit -m &lt;your commit message/tag&gt; Copy Code Here is the demonstration of saving changes from staging to the git repository using git commit command. 6. git push As the name suggests, `git push` pushes code from a local git repository to a remote server repository (such as GitLab, GitHub, or BitBucket). Note: The only committed changes will be pushed to the remote server repository by this command. How to use &quot;git push&quot;? This command can be used in multiple ways, but here we will focus on one method. # For the first time pushing a new branch git push -u origin &lt;your_branch_name&gt; #or git push --set-upstream origin &lt;your_branch_name&gt; For the second time, third time, etc. git push Copy Code Here is the demonstration for pushing a new branch to the remote repository. 7. git branch This command is related to branching, and branching is a very important and broad topic. `git branch` command is used to list, create, and delete the branches of your local git repository. How to use &quot;git branch&quot;? #To list all the branches git branch To create a new branch git branch &lt;branch_name&gt; To delete a branch git branch -d &lt;branch_name&gt; Copy Code Here is the demonstration for the git branch command. 8. git checkout This command is related to branches. `git checkout` is used to switch from one branch to another existing branch or we can create a branch at the time of switching with `git checkout -b `. How to use &quot;git checkout&quot;? # checkout to existing branch git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt; Checkout and create a new branch git checkout -b &lt;branch_name&gt; Copy Code Here is the demonstration for the git checkout command. 9. git merge By using `git merge`, you can merge your newly created or modified child branch with the parent branch. If you have completed your changes and development in the child branch, you must merge it into your parent branch to apply them to the entire project code base. How to use &quot;git merge&quot;? git merge &lt;branch_name&gt; Copy Code Here is the demonstration for the git merge command. 10. git pull `git pull` is used to pull (updated code) from the remote server repository to the local repository. It is a combination of two commands, git fetch and git merge. Initially, it will fetch the code and then merge it with the current branch. Note: Merge command in this process may create conflicts then you have resolved them manually. How to use &quot;git pull&quot;? git pull #or git pull origin #or git pull origin &lt;branch_name&gt; Copy Code Here is the demonstration for the git pull command. Hope you like all these commands.

            "content": "It is important to understand that an object in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a data structure that represents a real-world entity in memory. An entity has both attributes (data/variables) and behaviors (methods/functions) that describe its characteristics and actions. Suppose you have a Car class that defines the attributes and behaviors of a car, such as its model, year, and ability to accelerate and brake. Multiple Car objects could be created to represent specific cars, such as Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords. How to define a python class As an example of a simple Python class, here's what it looks like: class Car: def __init__(self, company, model, year): self.company = company self.model = model self.year = year self.speed = 0 def accelerate(self, rate): self.speed += rate def brake(self, rate): self.speed -= rate Copy Code This Car class has Three attributes(variables): company, model, and year. And twomethods(functions):accelerate and brake. Up until now, we have only defined a class that represents a blueprint/template, not a real-world car entity. In order to create a real car entity, we must create an object for that class. How to create an object of a python class To create an object of theCar class, we can use the Car class as a function and pass in the required attributes as given in the below example: my_car = Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020) Copy Code This creates a new my_car object with the company &quot;Toyota&quot;, model Camry, and year 2020. In the same way, that class can be used to create an unlimited number of objects. We can access and modify the attributes of the object using dot notation: print(my_car.make) # Output: Toyota print(my_car.model) # Output: Camry print(my_car.year) # Output: 2020 my_car.make = 'Honda' my_car.model = 'Accord' my_car.year = 2021 print(my_car.make) # Output: Honda print(my_car.model) # Output: Accord print(my_car.year) # Output: 2021 Copy Code To change the behavior of an object, we can also call its methods: my_car.accelerate(10) print(my_car.speed) # Output: 10 my_car.brake(5) print(my_car.speed) # Output: 5 Copy Code Using the example of a Car, we hope this clarifies what an object in OOP is.

            "content": "A constructor is a special method in classes that is called automatically (we don't have to call this method) when an object of the class is created. In simple terms, it is used to initialize the required attributes of an object at the time of object creation. If we talk about Python language the constructor is a method with the special name __init __. Class definitions define this method, which is automatically invoked by python interpreter when an object of the class is created. At least one argument must be provided to the __init __ method, self,it refers to the object that will be created. To initialize the some other attributes of an object, you can also define additional arguments. We can see that in the below example. A simple Car class in Python with a constructor looks like this: class Car: # constructor method def __init__(self, company, model, year): self.company = company self.model = model self.year = year self.speed = 0 Copy Code This Car class has a constructor __init __ with three arguments: company, model, and year. The __init __ method assigns these arguments to the corresponding attributes of the object. It also initializes thespeedattribute to 0. To create an object of the Car class, we can use the Car class as a function and pass in the required attributes like an example given below: # creating an object of class Car my_car = Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2022) Copy Code my_car is an object of class Car. Hence a new Car object is created with the company &quot;Toyota&quot;, the model &quot;Camry&quot;, and the year 2022. Speed is automatically set to 0 when the attribute is created. Hopefully, this clarifies what a Python constructor is. We would be glad to answer any other questions you may have!

An object of a class will have the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) defined in the class definition. Classes allow you to create multiple objects that share similar characteristics and behaviors. An example of a Car class would be one that defines the attributes and behaviors of a car, such as its company, model, year, acceleration, and braking capabilities. There could then be multiple objects of the Car class, each representing a specific car, such as a Toyota Camry or a Honda Accord. Here's an example of a simple Car class in Python: class Car: def __init__(self, make, model, year): self.make = make self.model = model self.year = year self.speed = 0 def accelerate(self, rate): self.speed += rate def brake(self, rate): self.speed -= rate Copy Code The above code example represents a class definition in the Python programming language. We can now create any number of objects using this class. To create some objects of the Car class, we can use the Car class as a function and pass in the required attributes: toyota_camry = Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020) honda_accord = Car('Honda', 'Accord', 2022) . . . Ford_mustang = Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2023) Copy Code It is our hope that this helps clarify what a programming class is. Feel free to ask me any further questions!

            "content": "In order to create a Python virtual environment, you must have Python installed on your computer. If you don't already have Python installed, you can download it from the Python website https://www.python.org/ and install it according to the instructions provided or you can follow this amazing blog. Once you have Python installed, you can create a virtual environment with two methods: 1 - venv: Module, which is included in Python by default. 2 - virtualenv: Package, which is a third-party package that provides additional functionality for managing virtual environments. Let's take a closer look at each of them one by one. How to create Python virtual environment with virtualenv? It is necessary to have Python and pip (the Python package manager) installed on your system before installing virtualenv. Once you have Python and pip installed, you can use pip to install virtualenv by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt: pip install virtualenv Copy Code This will install virtualenv on your system. To create a virtual environment with virtualenv, navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment and run the following command: virtualenv venv Copy Code Replace venv with the name you want to give your virtual environment. This will create a new directory called venv in the current directory, which will contain the files and directories needed for the virtual environment. To activate the virtual environment, run the following command: source venv/bin/activate Copy Code Replace venv with the name of your virtual environment. Once the virtual environment is activated, you should see the name of your virtual environment in parentheses at the beginning of the terminal prompt, like this: (venv) $. This indicates that the virtual environment is active and that any Python packages you install will be installed in the virtual environment, rather than in the global Python environment. To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command: deactivate This will take you out of the virtual environment, and you will no longer see the virtual environment's name in parentheses at the beginning of the terminal prompt. Now let's set with venv default module. How to create Python virtual environment with venv? The venv module, included by default in Python, allows you to create a virtual environment once you have Python installed. The steps are as follows: Run the following command to create a virtual environment: python -m venv myenv Copy Code To activate the virtual environment, run the following command: source myenv/bin/activate Copy Code To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command: deactivate Copy Code We hope this helps you in some way!

            "content": "In this answer, with the help of examples, we'll learn and see how the Python enumerate() method works. Example 1: Here is an example of how to enumerate() function works in Python: # Enumerate function: enumerate(iterable, start=0) An object of fruits list (supports iterator) fruits = [&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Grapes&quot;, &quot;Pear&quot;, &quot;BlueBerry&quot;] Now change this fruits list objects to enumerate object enumerate_fruits = enumerate(fruits) # Output: &lt;class 'enumerate'&gt; print(tuple(enumerate_fruits)) Copy Code Output ((0, 'Apple'), (1, 'Banana'), (2, 'Grapes'), (3, 'Pear'), (4, 'BlueBerry')) Copy Code The &quot;enumerate&quot; is a built-in function in Python. That converts a data collection object (Iterable objects like lists, tuples, or strings) into an enumerate object. Or We can say that the enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable. This can be useful for iterating over a sequence and keeping track of the current index. It can also be useful for creating a list of tuples with the position and value of each element. What is an enumerate object? enumerate object is also an iterator that produces tuples containing the position (position = index of iterator values + start) and the value of each element of the iterable object. As we already know enumerate is a function. Syntax enumerate(iterable, start=0) accept two parameters: 1 - iterable: (required, default = NA, type = iterator): A sequence or object that supports iteration. 2 - start: (optional: default = 0, type = int): A value from which to start counting for the position. Return value enumerate() return an enumerate object that is also iterable. Example 2: Let's see how we can use enumerate() function in loops. # An object of fruits list fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Grapes\", \"Pear\", \"BlueBerry\"] Simply loop over the enumerate object for fruit in enumerate(fruits): print(fruit, end = &quot; &quot;) # Will print a tuple Ex. (0, 'Apple') Let's Unpack the tuple out of two variable in the loop itself for position_index, fruit_name in enumerate(fruits): print(position_index, fruit_name, end= &quot;\\n&quot;) Now let's change default start value for position_index, fruit_name in enumerate(fruits, 10): print(position_index, fruit_name, end = &quot;\\n&quot;) Copy Code Output # (0, 'Apple') (1, 'Banana') (2, 'Grapes') (3, 'Pear') (4, 'BlueBerry') 0 Apple 1 Banana 2 Grapes 3 Pear 4 BlueBerry 10 Apple 11 Banana 12 Grapes 13 Pear 14 BlueBerry Copy Code Hope you understood the complete concept of enumerate() function.
